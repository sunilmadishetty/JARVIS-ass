We are going to create a virtual assistant named JARVIS (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) with a modern UI, similar to the one from Iron Man. The assistant will have a chat interface and will be able to respond to various commands and questions.

Features:

Voice recognition (using the Web Speech API)

Text-to-speech (using the Web Speech API)

Predefined commands (time, weather, jokes, etc.)

A responsive and stylish UI

We'll use:

HTML for structure

CSS for styling (with a modern, futuristic look)

JavaScript for functionality

Note: The Web Speech API is not supported in all browsers, so we'll check for compatibility.

Let's break down the code:

HTML Structure:

A header with the title and a subtitle.

A main chat area where messages (both user and JARVIS) will be displayed.

An input area with a text input and buttons for sending and voice recognition.

A footer with instructions.

CSS Styling:

Futuristic color scheme (dark background with blue and red accents).

Chat bubbles for messages.

Animations for when JARVIS is speaking or listening.

JavaScript:

We'll use the Web Speech API for speech recognition and synthesis.

We'll have a list of commands and responses.

We'll handle the chat interface, appending messages, and scrolling.
